# RacoSlave
RacoSlave is a script that notifies you (sending you a message through a telegram bot) when there is a new notice in one of your subjects.
It works by scrapping 
[**el RacÃ³**](https://raco.fib.upc.edu/home/portada/omar.anibal.garcia) and that is why it is necessary to have an account and furthermore you need to have a [telegram bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).

## Usage: 

- Install libreries

    ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

- Download geckodriver from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

    ```sudo apt-get install firefox```

- Rename configuration.copy.json to configuration.json and fill it

    ```mv configuration.copy.json configuration.json```

- Run main.py

    ```python3 main.py [--vdisplay]```
